            <p>Please note that all remote L1's are subject to case by case review and approval. You must have the recommendation of your Supervisor and meet the following criteria:</p>
            <br>
            <p></p>
            <p><b>Be in the top tier of Support metrics (on average for the past year):</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Top 25% of Cases per hour.</li>
                <li>High availability in live contacts.</li>
                <li>Operationally aware.</li>
                <li>Maintain a CSAT of 92% or higher.</li>
                <li>Work in Support for at least a year.</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <p><b>Be reliable:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Be at work on time every day, when going to be late (which should be the exception) notify your supervisor as soon as you know you will be late.</li>
                <li>Always be where you are supposed to be. We can't fight to get you on delegations or wonder "where is X person they should be logged into Y".</li>
                <li>Maintain the same quality and volume as when you were in the office.</li>
                <li>Have earned the trust of management to be able to work on your own without the support of a team physically around you or the physical presence of a Supervisor</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <p><b>Show a history of positive work ethic:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Team player, do you go out of your way to help your team?</li>
                <li>Can we rely on you to do what you are asked?</li>
                <li>Do you have the right attitude and demeanor with our users?</li>
                <li>Positive Attitude, does your attitude lift those around you and in turn lift our end users?</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <p><b>Environment:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Must live someplace outside of Utah</li>
                <li>Must have a dedicated workspace that is quiet, and has a door that will close out other noise.</li>
                <li>Must have a dependable internet connection to reliably take phone calls and chats.</li>
                <li>Must work assigned delegations without pushback or incident.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These are the metrics we ask about all remote employees. Those that are considered will need to understand and maintain the above standards. Any slip or fall in these metrics can and will result in immediate termination. Remote employees are not in the office to mentor and train so they must prove this standard of success prior to going remote.</p>

        </button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
            Are you tired of taking calls and chats? Are you hoping for more time to stream Twitch and Netflix? Then this job isn't for you. However, if you are looking to become a mentor to others, or looking to exercise your attention to detail, then keep reading.</p>
            <p></p>
             <p>The Instructure L2 Technical Support group is responsible for providing technical assistance to both the L1 Support group as well as Users.  A great L2 is able to lead L1's to the answer without outright giving them the answer. This means asking probing questions and finding out what the core issue is. L2's should have an excellent understanding between behaviors that are considered "bugs" and "features." This is where the baseline Canvas knowledge becomes extremely important.</p>
             <p></p>             
            <h3>Duties</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Must be proficient in all aspects of knowledge that a L1 would have in Canvas</li>
                    <li>Must know how to utilize their resources to troubleshoot cases.</li> 
                    <li>Must have demonstrated good prioritization skills, as L2's will be expected to determine and work urgent or pressing issues first.</li> 
                    <li>Must be able to resolve any bugs through the UI, utilizing tools such as API, CSV imports and console.</li> 
                    <li>If L2's are unable to resolve any issues with Canvas, then they must thoroughly test, and document the behavior into a Jira ticket.</li>
                    <li>L2's must be available to assist L1's with their cases via Slack, or in person.</li> 
                    <li>Must have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</li> 
                    <li>Able to communicate effectively and confidently with other departments such as Professional Services, Documentation, and Customer Success.</li>
                    <li>Must be available to hop into phones and chats to assist L1's (This is especially true during Fall and Spring semesters).</li>
                    <li>Must conduct trainings on Support tools as well as present new features in Team Meetings.</li> 
                </ul>
            <p></p>
            <h3>Requirements to apply</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Must have the recommendation of an L2 and your Supervisor (See description above).</li>
                    <li>Must pass an L2 knowledge test using Canvas. This test is a timed, open internet quiz. Peer help is strictly prohibited. (Seriously, it's grounds for termination. Don't cheat).</li>
                    <li>Must be above average in L1 metrics. This includes Customer Satisfaction ratings, Cases-per-hour, availability in assigned queues, and adherence to escalation policies (The 15 minute rule).</li>
                    <li>Must adhere to the "responsible" Time off policy of Instructure.</li> 
                    <li>Should be able to provide examples of escalations to current L2's that meet their expectation of quality.</li> 
                    <li>May be asked to sit down for an interview for the position.</li> 
                    <li>Strong written and verbal skills.</li>
                </ul>
